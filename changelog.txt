# 14 jul plan
- write test scripts
	- make git issue for this first!
	- test for spurious input via unit test
		- files that do not exist

# next steps
- write bash script that generates other bash scripts
	- generation is dependendent on specific input file (kmer_count or binary, across three kmer sizes)
	- to run for different method
- run code and record performance
- ensure environment file is fulfilled
	- make got issue for this as well!
	- command to use: conda env export --no-builds
- compare against nextflow pipeline maybe in secondary branch
	- or with raytune
